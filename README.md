# Gmail-Draft-Duplicator
This is a Gmail Add-On that you can use to duplicate email drafts on Gmail.

## Installation Instructions and How It Works:
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3JVWLKUrYs.

## TODOs:
- [ ] Activates without having to click on an email
- [ ] Also activates when clicking on an existing draft, with `Gmail Draft` menu automatically filled in
- [ ] `Number of Copies` input displays useful error message to the user if the user does not input a whole number
- [ ] Fields update without having to reload Gmail (for example, if you create a draft, the dropdown for selecting a draft shows this automatically)
- [ ] Draft number also updates without having to reload Gmail after creating duplicates
